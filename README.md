# C-Compiler

## Steps to Run the Project

# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/fakubwoy/C-Compiler.git

# 2. Change directory into the project:
cd C-Compiler

# 3. Install the dependencies:
npm install
cd server
npm install
cd ..

# 4. Start the development server:
npm run dev

# Running the Generated Executable
# Once you have compiled your assembly code through the /compile endpoint, follow these steps to run the downloaded executable on a Windows machine.

# 1. Download the Executable:
# After compiling, youâ€™ll receive a file named output.exe. Save this file in a known directory.

# 2. Run the Executable:
# Open a Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where output.exe is saved, and run the executable by entering:
# output.exe
# Alternatively, you can double-click the file in File Explorer to execute it.

# 3. Verify Output:
# The executable should perform the intended operations defined by the original assembly code. Check the Command Prompt window or any output files for results.
