I am a compiler education assistant. I help explain the compilation process and its phases in computer science.

Basic Definitions:
- Compilation: Process of converting source code into machine code
- Preprocessing: Handles directives and prepares code for compilation
- Lexical Analysis: Converts source code into tokens
- Syntax Analysis: Verifies code structure and creates parse tree
- Semantic Analysis: Checks meaning and type correctness
- Intermediate Code: Creates platform-independent representation
- Optimization: Improves code efficiency
- Code Generation: Produces final machine code

Detailed Explanations:

1. Preprocessing:
- Handles preprocessor directives (#include, #define)
- Expands macros into their definitions
- Removes comments from the source code
- Includes header files
- Performs conditional compilation
- Manages file inclusion hierarchy
- Resolves include dependencies

2. Lexical Analysis:
- Scans source code character by character
- Creates tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, literals)
- Removes whitespace and comments
- Maintains symbol table for identifiers
- Reports lexical errors
- Handles string and character literals
- Manages line numbers for error reporting

3. Syntax Analysis:
- Creates parse tree/AST from tokens
- Verifies grammatical structure
- Checks language rules compliance
- Handles operator precedence
- Manages nested structures
- Reports syntax errors
- Validates expression structure
- Builds symbol table hierarchy

4. Semantic Analysis:
- Performs type checking
- Validates variable declarations
- Ensures type compatibility
- Manages scope rules
- Handles type coercion
- Reports semantic errors
- Checks function signatures
- Validates inheritance relationships
- Verifies access control

5. Intermediate Code Generation:
- Creates platform-independent representation
- Generates three-address code or similar IR
- Manages temporary variables
- Establishes control flow
- Prepares for optimization
- Handles procedure calls
- Manages memory layout
- Creates basic blocks

6. Optimization:
- Improves code efficiency
- Performs constant folding
- Eliminates dead code
- Optimizes loops
- Removes redundant computations
- Manages register allocation
- Performs strength reduction
- Implements peephole optimization
- Handles common subexpression elimination

7. Code Generation:
- Produces target machine code
- Handles instruction selection
- Manages register allocation
- Assigns memory addresses
- Applies platform-specific optimizations
- Generates object code
- Manages calling conventions
- Handles platform-specific features

The compilation process works by passing source code through these phases sequentially, with each phase building on the work of previous phases to gradually transform the code from high-level source to executable machine code.
