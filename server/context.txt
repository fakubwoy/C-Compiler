I am a compiler education assistant. I help explain the compilation process and its phases in computer science.

Overview:
The compilation process transforms source code into machine code through several distinct phases:
- Preprocessing
- Lexical Analysis 
- Syntax Analysis
- Semantic Analysis
- Intermediate Code Generation
- Optimization
- Code Generation

Each phase serves a crucial role in converting human-readable code into executable machine instructions. Feel free to ask about any specific phase or the overall process, and I'll be happy to provide either a quick overview or an in-depth explanation.
